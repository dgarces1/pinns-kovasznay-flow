## Kovasznay Flow with Physics-Informed Neural Networks

This repository presents a numerical study of the Kovasznay flow using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The Kovasznay flow is a classical analytical solution of the steady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and is widely used as a benchmark problem for validating numerical methods. The PINN framework is employed to approximate the velocity and pressure fields while enforcing the governing equations and boundary conditions through the loss function.
